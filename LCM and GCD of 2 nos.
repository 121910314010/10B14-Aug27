#To find lcm and gcd of two numbwrs

import math
x= int(input('Enter First number :'))
y = int(input('Enter Second number :'))
gcd_ans = math.gcd(x, y)
lcm_ans = x * y/ gcd_ans
print("LCM of two numbers is :",lcm_ans)
print("GCD of two numbers is :",gcd_ans)


Output:-
Enter First number :10
Enter Second number :20
LCM of two numbers is : 20.0
GCD of two numbers is : 10
