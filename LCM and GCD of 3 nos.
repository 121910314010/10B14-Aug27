#To find lcm and gcd of three numbers

import math
x= int(input('Enter First number :'))
y =int(input('Enter Second number :'))
z= int(input('Enter Second number :'))
gcd_ans = math.gcd(x,y)
gcd_final=math.gcd(gcd_ans,z)
lcm_ans = x*y/ gcd_final
print("LCM of three numbers is:",lcm_ans)
print("GCD of three numbers is:",gcd_final)


Output:-
Enter First number :10
Enter Second number :20
Enter Second number :30
LCM of three numbers is: 20.0
GCD of three numbers is: 10
